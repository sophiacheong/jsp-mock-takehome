# jsp-thcc-1
 
 This take-home coding challenge is a real-world example of a timeboxed prompt that asks you to connect to an external API, display the results, and implement light user interactivity.

 
 ## Project setup and specs
 
 There are two documents, the first of which (`SETUP.md`) would be delivered when you move forward in the interview process. It allows you to setup your local development environment and prepare the app framework. There are also instructions to receive the project specs, at which point your time would begin.

 The second document (`PROJECT_SPEC.md`) contains instructions to build your mini app and submit the project. In a real-world THCC, you would have 2.5 hours to deliver the project, and time begins upon receiving the specs.

 You can take this challenge in two ways:

 ### 1. Simulate time-limited challenge
 To see how far you get in the actual time limit provided by this type of take-home coding challenge, read the `SETUP.md` document only. Follow all of the instructions. Set aside 2.75-3 uninterrupted hours, and only then should you read the `PROJECT_SPEC.md` to begin.

 ### 2. Focus only on template development
 If your goal is only to develop a template for this type of challenge (rather than to test your performance under the 2.5 hour time limit), follow the instructions in `SETUP.md` first, then `PROJECT_SPEC.md`.
